Code for Arduino project EcoBot will be available here 

Information about EcoBot

1: Mission statement 

Ecobot strives to connect programming and engineering to solve real world problems that we face today. Every day, we hear about more tragedies that happen due to pollution and global warming. In order to combat its effect, we need to look to find more efficient and effective solutions. By creating the Ecobot, we use our knowledge to make our community more sustainable, and hopefully in the future, are able to inspire and expand more engineering solutions to climate change.   

2: Who we are

Shuban and Sanjay are rising seniors at West Windsor Plainsboro High School North. 

3: The robot itself

Our robot consists of a 4 wheel drive and a scooping mechanism, where pieces of trash and plastic can easily be collected and stored in a container. The drivetrain is powered by 4 dc motors, controlled by an arduino mega. We hope to move from controller based robot to an autonmous robot that uses image recognition. 

4: Design

We chose a scooping mechanism because of how we could connect it to the servo motors provided by arduino. The base of the robot is taken up by the storage, and we made it so the weight distribution is evened out because of it. We chose to have a slanted slab in the container to allow pieces of trash to slide through without clumping on one side.

5: Build process 

We began by brainstorming various robot designs for the task. We wanted to focus on the environmental problem of pollution, because of the many trials near us and how we can use robotics to solve the problem locally. We saw many possible designs to take inspiration from, ending up with the scooping mechanism. Instead of starting straight away on our main robot, we decided to use a prototype made from parts designed by cardboard to mimic our robots functions. It allowed us to properly test our code without running the risk of damaging the robot. This debugging phase helped us greatly, as we were able to make many improvements to the code.
